# Implementation Plan for Merging Extended OpenAI Conversation with Upstream

## Overview
This plan details how to implement the merge of Extended OpenAI Conversation component with the upstream changes from Home Assistant's OpenAI integration.

## Files Created

We've created merged versions of the following files:

1. **const.py** - Combined constants from both components
2. **manifest.json** - Updated with latest requirements and dependencies
3. **services.yaml** - Combined service definitions
4. **conversation.py** - New file based on upstream with added Azure support
5. **services.py** - Combined services implementation
6. **__init__.py** - Updated initialization with Azure support
7. **config_flow.py** - Updated config flow with both upstream and extended features

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create a New Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b merge-upstream-response-api
   ```

2. **Replace/Create Files**
   ```bash
   cp merge-plan/const.py custom_components/extended_openai_conversation/
   cp merge-plan/manifest.json custom_components/extended_openai_conversation/
   cp merge-plan/services.yaml custom_components/extended_openai_conversation/
   cp merge-plan/conversation.py custom_components/extended_openai_conversation/
   cp merge-plan/services.py custom_components/extended_openai_conversation/
   cp merge-plan/__init__.py custom_components/extended_openai_conversation/
   cp merge-plan/config_flow.py custom_components/extended_openai_conversation/
   ```

3. **Update helpers.py if needed**
   The current implementation should work with updated files, but double-check for any changes needed.

4. **Testing**
   - Test with regular OpenAI
   - Test with Azure OpenAI 
   - Test with new features like web search
   - Test with image query service
   - Test with generate_image and generate_content services

5. **Update README and Documentation**
   - Document new features
   - Update requirements and version information

## Key Changes

1. **New API Usage**
   - Shifted from Chat Completions API to Response API
   - Updated function calling mechanism

2. **New Features**
   - Web search support for gpt-4o models
   - Image generation with DALL-E
   - Content generation with media support (images, PDFs)

3. **Enhanced Configuration**
   - Added "recommended" settings toggle
   - Added reasoning effort options for o-series models
   - Preserved extended configuration options

4. **Azure OpenAI Support**
   - Maintained Azure compatibility
   - Added specific handling for Azure deployments vs. models

## Notes
- Make sure to test the component thoroughly 
- Verify Azure OpenAI compatibility with the new API approach
- Check all services work as expected
- Release notes should emphasize the major architecture changes
